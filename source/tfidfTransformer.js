/*
The formula that is used to compute the tf-idf of term t is 

tf-idf(d, t) = tf(t) * idf(d, t)

and the idf is computed as 
idf(d, t) = log [ n / df(d, t) ] + 1 (if smooth_idf=False)

where n is the total number of documents and df(d, t) is the document frequency
the document frequency is the number of documents d that contain term t. 
The effect of adding “1” to the idf in the equation above is that terms with zero idf
i.e., terms that occur in all documents in a training set, will not be entirely ignored. 

(Note that the idf formula above differs from the standard textbook notation that defines the idf 
as idf(d, t) = log [ n / (df(d, t) + 1) ]).
